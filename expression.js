//class statements and Class expressions

//In javascript you can have classes as statements, that we saw in last lecture
//but they can also be expressions, just like we have both options for functions 
//in javascript

//so we can have a class created like this
class Title{

}

//and we can also have a class created like

const title = class Title{
    //

}

// console.log(Title.prototype);
